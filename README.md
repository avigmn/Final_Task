Properties Price Prediction project:

The aim of this project was to take properties data, clean and prepare it (madlan_data_prep.py), and make an  Machine Learning model that can predict the final price of properties (model_training.py).
For this reason I handle with Missing Data and used Feature Engineering, One-Hot-Encoding, and Feature Scaling for the preparing.
For the prediction I have used an Elastic-Net model.
As a final step, I created a Flask application that displays it in real time (api.py).
